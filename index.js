// Write your code here
// 1) is an equation whose multiplied results will equal 62
let num1 = 1
let num2 = 62
let multiply = num1 * num2

// 3) is an equation that calculates a remainder that is equal to 4
let num3 = 3.5
let num4 = 14
let mod = num4 / num3

// 2) generates a random integer greater than 0 
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() + 1 )

// 4) will return 20 as the highest number in the set

let max = Math.max(1, 20, 2)
